# 🐍 Python Data Analysis Project

## 🔹 Overview
This project demonstrates *data analysis using Python*.  
The analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook using *Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn* to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset.  
The goal is to extract insights and present them clearly in both visual and report formats.

## 🔹 Project Steps
1. *Data Cleaning*  
   - Handling missing values.  
   - Removing duplicates.  
   - Formatting data types.  

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Statistical summaries.  
   - Grouping and aggregations with Pandas.  

3. *Data Visualization*  
   - Bar charts, line plots, and histograms using Matplotlib & Seaborn.  
   - Trend analysis and categorical comparisons.  

4. *Insights & Reporting*  
   - Key business insights were extracted from the analysis.  
   - A final report was prepared summarizing the findings.
